To keep it *short* and *sweet*, creamcityscene.com is a script that pulls music performance data from Songkick for the Milwaukee Metro area today, and builds a Spotify playlist containing all those artists. The playlist updates around 4:30am CT EVERY DAY! This site is an information compliment to the playlist to provide more information about the artists.

Presented with no claims of functionality. Right now it's based on a pretty crude Spotify API search. If you think you should be listed, and don't see yourself, make double sure your band name is exactly the same in Songkick and Spotify.

I hope you enjoy it! If you have any comments or questions, you can reach me on Twitter at [@ivaneisenberg](https://twitter.com/ivaneisenberg)
